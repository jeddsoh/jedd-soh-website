I'm a multidisciplinary designer and developer with expertise in product design, web development, and design systems. I specialize in creating digital experiences that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering, from startups to enterprise organizations.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at bloombox, leading strategic initiatives for creative technology. I've worked across various roles including Design Ops at Wipro, Web Developer at frank., and Product Designer at Affirm, always focusing on user-centered solutions and performance optimization.

With a background in Creative Media Production and Chinese studies from the University of Oklahoma, I bring a unique perspective to design and development challenges. In my spare time, I'm usually exploring creative projects, learning new technologies, or diving into design systems.
